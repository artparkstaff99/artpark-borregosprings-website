March is a blooming good time in the ArtPark!&nbsp; Volunteers have planted thousands of seeds for spring veggies and flow Hummingbirds are loving the aloe bloom.  Hummingbirds and the bees (big thanks to Desert Bee Company!) are doing their part to ensure everything is pollinated.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;If you have noticed the orchard trees recently - the first trees to blossom each spring are the nectarines bringing a flush of pink to the middle row, followed by peaches, and then the beautiful white flowers of the apple trees.&nbsp; The gardenscape is changing daily so stop by often! The ArtPark docent program still has a few openings.&nbsp; This is your opportunity to welcome visitors and locals to the gardens!&nbsp; Contact Wade at&nbsp;[artfarm@borregoartinstitute.org](mailto:artfarm@borregoartinstitute.org)&nbsp;to learn more.\
