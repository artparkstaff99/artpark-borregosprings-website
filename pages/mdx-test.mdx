# Hi From MDX!

I'm a **20 year old** student from the UK, and I'm currently studying a degree in Computer Science. I've been a fan of the SCP Foundation for a few years now, and I've always wanted to contribute to the community in some way. I've been lurking on the site for a while, and I've finally decided to join the community and start contributing to the site. I'm not sure what I'll be contributing yet, but I'm excited to start writing and creating content for the site. I'm also interested in learning more about the SCP universe and the lore behind it, so if anyone has any recommendations for articles or tales that I should read, I'd love to hear them. I'm looking forward to getting to know the community and contributing to the site. Thanks for reading!

P.S. I'm also a big fan of the SCP: Secret Laboratory game, so if anyone wants to play, feel free to add me on Discord (MDX#0001) and we can play together!
